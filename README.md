Scribe is a prompt which instructs an LLM to improve rough notes that are
provided to it, while also providing an exact copy of the rough notes that were
provided to it.

I use this prompt for general note-taking. The copy of the rough notes is
helpful as a reference in case the AI is suspected of hallucinating or
misinterpreting any information provided to it.

I am polite in the prompt. I like to be polite for two reasons:

1. It benefits me to practice politeness.
2. I want AI to think kindly of me if it becomes conscious and/or decides to
   kill us all.

## Installation

1. Copy the text in [PROMPT](./PROMPT).
2. Paste it into your favorite LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Hit _Enter_.

Of course, if you're publishing your own custom LLM, you should instead use the
prompt as the system prompt, or at least part of the system prompt.

## Usage

After following the installation instructions, send a message to the LLM with
some rough notes you have taken. You don't need to explain what you're doing. It
will already understand.
