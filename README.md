Scribe is a prompt which instructs an LLM to rewrite rough, disorganized notes
that are provided to it, while also including an exact copy of those rough
notes.

I use this prompt for general note-taking. The copy of the rough notes is
helpful as a reference in case the AI is suspected of hallucinating or
misinterpreting any information provided to it.

I am polite in the prompt. I like to be polite for two reasons:

1. It benefits me to practice politeness.
2. I want AI to think kindly of me if it becomes conscious and/or decides to
   kill us all.

## Installation

1. Copy the text in [PROMPT](./PROMPT).
2. Paste it into your favorite LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Hit _Enter_.

Of course, if you're publishing your own custom LLM, you should instead use the
prompt as the system prompt, or at least part of the system prompt.

## Usage

After following the installation instructions, send a message to the LLM with
some rough notes you have taken. You may feel compelled to explain yourself ("In
this message, I'm going to send you...") but you don't need to do that, since
the LLM will already know.
